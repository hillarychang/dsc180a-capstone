Q1 Project Proposal B02 - Kevin Wong, Kurumi Kaneko, Jevan Chahal, Hillary Chang

Questions:
How will we create a categorization model in order to sort memos into respective categories?\
- Test for accuracy, latency
- Make sure to choose specific one based on what we want to prioritize
How will we estimate income of a consumer based on their purchases?

Methods:
Categorization Model (NLP)
(Classification Model)
- Logistic Regression (fast, reliable, easy-to-implement, not as accurate) 
- XGBoost (fast, reliable, complicated)
- Transformer (slower - latency, complicated to implement, hyperparamters are difficult)
    - Neural Network (faster than transformer)
- Tree (fast, somewhat reliable, hyperparameters can be difficult)


Estimating Income - NOTE: Two part problem (go with inflows and outflows), One part problem (inflows); ask during lecture
(Regression Model)
- Gross Income: Amount earned at a job (i.e. Salary, Earnings, etc)
- Net Income: Amount earned - amount spent 

- XGBoost 
- Neural Network
- Decision Trees
- Linear Regression

Work Needed to Do:
- Github Creation (Lesson 3)
    - Sorting/Organization
- Train/Test/Split
- Data Cleaning
    - Memo fields (WALMART****10/23 SALE -> WALMART)
    - No NA values
    - Dates are cleaned (no time specific ones)
- Identify the categories that we want to use:
    - Use the ones already in the Data
- Model Creation 
    - First try simple models
    - Do more complex methods
- System Resources
    - 1 GPU, 4 Cores, DSMLP (neural networks & XGBoost)
